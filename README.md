👋 Hey there, I'm Sophia Palomo!

🚀 Full-stack web developer fueled by a passion for coding and a commitment to continuous growth.

💼 I've successfully completed a full-stack web development boot camp and am eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting. My journey to master JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React is in full swing. Additionally, I'm actively expanding my horizons with Python, C#, and Java.

🤝 I'm actively seeking internship opportunities where I can collaborate on exciting projects and gain practical experience in software development. Let's connect if you have an internship opening or a project that could benefit from my skills!

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying a swim or immersing myself in video games. Valorant and League of Legends are my current favorites.

📫 If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic software engineer with a blend of technical skills, creativity, and a strong work ethic, let's connect and explore exciting projects together!
